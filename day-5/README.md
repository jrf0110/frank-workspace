# Todo Application

Let's recall what we went over last time. We had a clean separation between models and views, and our `index.html` tied it all together.

Using those same ideas, let's build a Todo application.

Some folks might focus on a certain aspect of the application process, but we are going full-stack and we're just going to work on this app together until completion.

## Application Summary

Our application should be comprised of a list todos. Each todo should be editable and should be able to be marked as _completed_. Each todo should be able to also have its _completed_ status reverted. Each todo should be able to be deleted. Users should be able to add new todo items.
